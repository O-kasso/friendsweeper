### What is this?
A simple tool that automates erasing all public evidence of your friendship with someone on Facebook. Since Facebook doesn't delete wall post history between you and a friend, even
after you unfriend them or they delete their account, this is a useful way to purge many years of history.

### Why launch the browser? Why not PhantomJS / Chrome headless?
It's nice to get the visual feedback that the tool is actually working! Also, Facebook's layout can be finnicky so it just make's it easier to catch when something goes awry

### Won't this break whenever Facebook changes their layout (which is often)?
Yup! This is just a quick tool I threw together for a small personal use case.

### Why do I have to run this locally? Couldn't this be a web app?
Meh, didn't feel like messing with Facebook authentication. Currently, the end-user needs to log into Facebook themselves.
